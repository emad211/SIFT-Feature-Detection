# SIFT Feature Detection 🔍

## 📌 Introduction
This project explores **Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)** for detecting keypoints in images under different transformations. We analyze the impact of contrast threshold variations and geometric transformations (scaling and rotation) on the detected features.

## 🚀 Features
- **Keypoint Detection**: Using SIFT to extract feature points from an input image.
- **Threshold Analysis**: Evaluating how different contrast threshold values affect the number of detected keypoints.
- **Geometric Transformations**: Scaling and rotating images and analyzing how SIFT responds.
- **Visualization**:
  - Plots showing the relationship between contrast threshold and keypoint count.
  - Image grids displaying keypoint detection on transformed images.
